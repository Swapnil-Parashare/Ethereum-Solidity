# Ethereum-Solidity  
Basic Ethereum Project1  
Here I have learned how to do following stuff :-  
1] Writing basic solidity smart contract and compiling it.  
2] Testing it using mocha on local ganache network.    
3] Deploying it to Rinkeby Test Network.   
4] Interacting with our deployed contract through "Remix".
